# 🧬 Genetic Influence on Athletic Performance 🏃‍♀️🏋️‍♂️

*A research-meets-AI project exploring how our DNA might just be the secret behind our speed, strength, and stamina.*

---

## 🌟 About the Project

This project investigates how certain **genetic markers**—specifically the **ACTN3** and **ACE** genes—are linked to athletic abilities like power, endurance, and muscle strength.

We combined scientific research with machine learning to:

* 📖 Understand genetic impact on performance
* 🧪 Analyze real genotype-performance data
* 🤖 Train classification models to predict athletic potential

> Your sprint speed might be written in your genes... or at least, partly!

## 🧠 What We Did

* Researched the role of **ACTN3** and **ACE** polymorphisms in athletes.
* Collected performance datasets and gene sequences.
* Preprocessed and labeled data using **Naïve string matching** and bioinformatics tools.
* Trained several models:

  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Decision Trees
  * Random Forest
  * Naive Bayes
* Applied **PCA** to visualize genotype clusters.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* Python
* scikit-learn
* Pandas & NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Bioinformatics datasets from NCBI & Zenodo

---

## 📊 Results

Our models showed promising accuracy in genotype classification and supported the strong correlation between **genetics and athletic performance**—especially in traits like speed and endurance.
